file description

create README, AUTHORS files
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes
Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()). Now itâ€™s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands
Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel
Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: .all()
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: .count()
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: .show()
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: .destroy()
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: .update(,, )
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary
Write all unittests for console.py, all features!
